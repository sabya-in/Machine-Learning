This is a version of same code as V0.0
implemented with Keras for the neural network , 
the learning is super slow but the model shows improvement
after longer time.

This never reaches the goal, I realise this is missing action replay.

Our model forgets data from previous Data packets, so we need either of:
a. Action replay
or
b. A method that does not forget previous interations (will LSTM work ?)
